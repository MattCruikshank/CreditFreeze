    <h1>Credit Freeze</h1>

      I am not a lawyer, or an accountant, or any kind of expert.  This is merely the best advice I could find,
      pulled from the internet.  I have not yet followed these instructions myself.  Follow them at your own
      risk.

    <h2>Record Your Phone Calls</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Caveat: Depending on the laws in your state, it may be illegal for you to record your phone calls.  I am not going
        to give you legal advice about that.</i>

        I've seen reports that specifically at the stage where the Credit Agencies give you your new PIN, which is
        critically important, they speak too quickly, and don't give you an option to have it repeated to you, and then
        they hang up.  With that in mind, it may make sense to record your phone calls.  If you're going to record your
        phone calls, you should test your methodology - so ask a friend for help, and test out a recording.

        There's an Android App that I've seen people recommend, called ACR.

        I don't know what to recommend for iPhone.

    <h2>Have Your Credit Card Ready</h2>
      <p>
        I've seen reports that the agencies are completely impatient with you, and if you delay even momentarily
        they may transfer you to another department, and your call may get dropped when they do that - forcing you
        to start all over again.  Therefore, I recommend having your Credit Card ready before you call.
