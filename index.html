      I am not a lawyer, or an accountant, or any kind of expert.  This is merely the best advice I could find,
      pulled from the internet.  I have not yet followed these instructions myself.  Follow them at your own
      risk.

    <h2>Suggestions I Have Seen</h2>
    <h3>Get A Copy of Your Credit Report Right Now</h3>
      <p>
        The Federal Government of the United States wrote a law relating to credit agencies, saying individual consumers
        must be able to get a free credit report each year.  And there was one and only one website where you can access
        that free report:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action">AnnualCreditReport.com</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are <b>tons</b> of imitiation sites, but none of them are the One True Annual Credit Report that government
        regulations make available to you.  All of the rest of them are operating because some company is paying to make
        them available to you.  Why would they do that?  To collect your information, and to advertise products to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are legally entitled to a free credit report from that site, every year.  I believe it's basically a year
        and a day after your last request.  So, you should put something on your calendar, and get your next report as
        close as you can get to one year and one day later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is proof that that is the one and only legally mandated free credit report site:

      </ul>
      </p>
    <h3>Record Your Phone Calls</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Caveat: Depending on the laws in your state, it may be illegal for you to record your phone calls.  I am not going
        to give you legal advice about that.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen reports that specifically at the stage where the Credit Agencies give you your new PIN, which is
        critically important, they speak too quickly, and don't give you an option to have it repeated to you, and then
        they hang up.  With that in mind, it may make sense to record your phone calls.  If you're going to record your
        phone calls, you should test your methodology - so ask a friend for help, and test out a recording.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's an Android App that I've seen people recommend, called ACR.
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.acr">Here's the link to it.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what to recommend for iPhone.
      </p>
    <h3>Have Your Credit Card Ready</h3>
      <p>
        I've seen reports that the agencies are completely impatient with you, and if you delay even momentarily
        they may transfer you to another department, and your call may get dropped when they do that - forcing you
        to start all over again.  Therefore, I recommend having your Credit Card ready before you call.
